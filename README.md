This is a part of the large project.
In this project we mainly use java to create some fonts that we need.
To show the results, We decide to use Libgdx and the extension package freetype to implement on the differents fonts.
For the result show on desktop, we would use the Gradle compiler. For more details, view the link https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.
